## Jesus Called a Woman a Dog?!?
The way that Jesus speaks to this woman has been the source of much
controversy, especially given the meaning and use of "dog" as a
chauvinist slur towards women in our culture. When we see Jesus
seemingly refer to this woman as one of the dogs, it can make us very
uncomfortable, to say the least. And we shouldn't pretend that it
doesn't.

But I've come to realise that this story of the Syro-Phoenician woman is
an incredibly important story in the Gospel of Mark. And that the
message it tells --- when we see what Mark is doing --- is profound.

## Jesus Retreats
In this story we see Jesus retreating. In his hometown and the areas he
has been walking around so far in Mark's Gospel, he can't go anywhere
without people coming to him --- with their problems, challenging him,
trying to get something from him. So he retreats to the coastal area of
Tyre and Sidon. It almost feels like he's gone on a beach holiday.

But this is the first time in Mark's Gospel that he has stepped outside
his Israeli context. Tyre and Sidon are part of the region Matthew calls
Syro-Phoenicia. Wealthy port cities. Supplied with goods from Galilee
--- the rural region Jesus comes from.

## The Geography

    G --- T
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Woman: Privileged and Disadvantaged
And this is where a woman from Tyre and Sidon --- a woman from the
Gentile world --- comes to Jesus and falls at his feet.

He is the rural, working-class Galilean.\
She is the metropolitan, wealthy woman.

On one hand, she is at a significant cultural disadvantage because she
is a woman. On the other hand, she has significant social advantage
because of her socioeconomic status.

And yet she comes vulnerable.

She brings shame upon herself --- a lone woman falling at the feet of a
strange man. And not just any man, but someone lower in the social
pecking order than her. She crosses every cultural boundary to come to
the one she knows can heal her daughter.

And this is where Jesus is faced with a quandary.

Up to this point, his ministry has been focused on Israel. The
expectation that Israel had for the Messiah was that he was primarily for the people of Israel. And yet this woman is asking that the blessing be poured out not just on Israel, but on the nations.

This is where we see the genius of Mark's writing.

## The Crumb Sandwich
He has placed this story equidistant between two very similar stories:

-   The feeding of the 5,000 in Mark 6:30-44
-   The feeding of the 4,000 in Mark 8:1-10

Twelve baskets are left over in the first.\
Seven baskets in the second.

That is not random.

## The Sandwich Shape

    A --> B
    B --> C
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------


In the feeding of the 5,000, bread is multiplied and twelve baskets of
fragments are gathered up. Twelve --- echoing the twelve
tribes of Israel.

Then comes this woman.


## Audacious Foreign Women keeping the people of God on track
Jesus says, "Let the children be fed first." The language is still
feeding language. Still bread language.

And she responds, "Even the dogs under the table eat the crumbs."

She doesn't reject the metaphor. She pushes it further.

She has noticed something. She has understood something about the
character of God. That Israel was never called to be a holy huddle,
sectioned off from the rest of the world. Abraham was called to be a
blessing to the nations.

And throughout Israel's history there are women from outside the tribe,
outside the nation, who seem to understand this better than the
insiders. Rahab. Ruth. Esther. Women who, with a kind of holy
audacity, expose how wide God's grace truly is.

This woman stands in that line.

She sees that even though the people of God are gathered to feast on his
blessings, the economy of the kingdom is not scarcity. It is abundance.

## The Avalanche of Crumbs is an Avalanche of Grace
From a table with a few loaves and fish come baskets and baskets and
baskets of overflow. The crumbs from the table are not a consolation prize. They are an avalanche of Grace.

After this encounter comes the feeding of the 4,000. Seven baskets.
Seven --- the number of fullness, completeness, universality. A widening
out.

Mark is showing us two forms of blessing. First Israel. Then the
nations.

And right in the middle stands a woman who sees it before the disciples
do.


## Jesus calls the woman to preach
Perhaps Jesus initially turns her down because he knows she has seen
something. He gives her the dignity of saying it out loud. In Mark's
Gospel, the disciples repeatedly fail to grasp what is going on. There
is a hiddenness to Jesus' mission. And here, unexpectedly, a Gentile
woman articulates the heart of it.

She preaches.

Not because Jesus needs correcting. But because sometimes the Father
speaks through the margins to signal that the moment has come.

## The Question for us
So the question for us is this:

When we gather to worship, when we use our resources as a church, do we
realise that we have nothing to be afraid of when blessing flows
outward?

Do we recognise the economy of crumbs?

And when someone comes from outside --- from beyond our expected
boundaries --- are we curious enough to notice the wisdom they might be
offering?

The crumbs that the woman talks about are not normal leftovers. They are an avalanche of Grace flowing out from the table to bless the Nations.
