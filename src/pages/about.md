# Who I am
Hi! I’m Alasdair Munday, a software developing follower of Jesus on the road to ordination in the Church of England. I live at the intersection of faith, music, and technology: whether I’m unpacking the book of Proverbs, building an app prototype, or leading excessively long worship sessions, I’m always asking how head, heart, and hands can work together to contribute to God's project of liberation and restoration.

# What I care about
## Jesus
•	Living Presence: Experiencing Jesus not as a distant figure but as a day-to-day companion—whether I’m debugging code or tuning my bass.
•	Authentic Discipleship: Following Jesus means honest questions and messy growth; I care more about real faith than polished platitudes.
•	Head, Heart & Hands: Jesus modeled thoughtful love, passionate devotion, and practical service—and I want to do the same in theology, worship, and community projects.

## People
•	Welcoming Community: Creating spaces where all stories are heard, struggles are shared, and newcomers feel at home (pizza optional but encouraged).
•	Justice & Compassion: Standing with the marginalized—small acts of kindness or supporting local initiatives, I’m all in for fairness and hope.
•	Collaboration & Growth: Whether pairing up at a Kingdom Code hackathon or co-leading a Bible study, I believe our best work happens when we listen, iterate, and learn together.

## The Bible
•	Scripture as Story: Diving into Biblical narratives—Genesis to Revelation—as living texts that shape our identity and calling.
•	Practical Wisdom: Mining Proverbs, Paul’s letters, and the psalms for guidance in tech ethics, worship design, and everyday life.
•	Ongoing Discovery: From group exegesis sessions to solo meditation, I care about wrestling with the text so it wrestles with me in return.
